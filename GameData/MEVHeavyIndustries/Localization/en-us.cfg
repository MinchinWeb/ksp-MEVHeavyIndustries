	// Parts
		#MEV-BussardFusion-titl = Bussard Drive
		#MEV-BussardFusion-desc = The Bussard Drive is an engine that utilises pellets of solid Hydrogen as fusion fuel, thus making it more efficent then the Daedalus which makes it the most efficent engine for interstellar travel

		#MEV-DaedalusDrive-titl = Daedalus Drive
		#MEV-DaedalusDrive-desc = The Daedalus drive is a fusion engine that compresses and fuses pellets of Deuterium helium-3 for propulsion. It is highly efficent and is meant to be used to propel your ships towards other stars.

		#MEV-EpsteinDrive-titl = Epstein Drive
		#MEV-EpsteinDrive-desc = An incredibly advanced engine with a fuel system too complex for you to understand, this Epstein Drive is going to take you anywhere with a bone-crushing acceleration. Warranty void if you black out from the acceleration.
		#MEV-EpsteinDrive-MME-primary-name = Mode: LiquidFuel
		#MEV-EpsteinDrive-MME-secondary-name = Mode: Overdrive

		#MEV-EpsteinDriveV4-titl = Epstein Drive (smaller)
		#MEV-EpsteinDriveV4-desc = A smaller version of our Epstein Drive.
